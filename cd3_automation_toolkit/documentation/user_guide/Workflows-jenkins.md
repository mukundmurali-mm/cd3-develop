# Using the Automation Toolkit via Jenkins

## **Pre-reqs for Jenkins Configuration**
* Validation of createTenancyConfig.py output:
  - jenkins.properties file should have been created under /cd3user/tenancies/jenkins_home  as per input parameters in tenancyConfig.properties<br>
  - An Object Storage bucket should have been created in OCI in the specified compartment to manage tfstate remotely. <br>
  - Customer Secret Key should have been configured for the user for S3 credentials of the bucket. <br>
  - A DevOps Project, Repo and Topic should have been created in OCI in the specified compartment to store terraform_files. <br>


## **Initialization of Jenkins**

* Execute below cmd to start Jenkins - <br>
```/usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.sh &```

* Access Jenkins URL using -
  - https://\<IP of the Jenkins Host\>:<Port>/ <br>
    Notes  - <Port> is the port mapped with local system while docker container creation eg 8443
           - Network Connectivity should be allowed on this host and port.
  - It will prompt you to create first user to access Jenkins URL. This will be the admin user.
  - Once you login, here is the Jenkins dashboard:

## **Introduction to Jenkins**
On the Jenkins dashboard, you will see -
1. setUpOCI Pipeline
2. terraform_files Folder
3. Region based Views

The process of invocation/execution of these stages is explained in the next pages.

### setUpOCI Pipeline

This is equivalent to running setUpOCI.py from CLI. Below table shows the stages executed in this pipeline along with their description:

#### setUpOCI Pipeline Stages :

|Stage Name      | Description  | Possible Outcomes |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| <b>Validate Input Parameters</b> | Validates input file name/size, selected parameters | Displays Unstable if any of the validation fails. Pipeline stops further execution in that case. |
| <b>Update setUpOCI.properties</b> | Updates <customer_name>_setUpOCI.properties with input filename and workflow_type | Displays Failed if any issue during execution |
| <b>Execute setUpOCI</b> | Executes python code to generate required tfvars files. The console output for this stage is similar to setUpOCI.py execution via CLI | Displays Failed if any issue during execution |
| <b>Run Import Commands</b> | Based on the workflow_type as 'Export Resources from OCI', this stage invokes execution of tf_import_commands_* shell scripts which will import the exported objects into tfstate. <b> This stage is skipped for 'Create Resources in OCI' workflow </b>| Displays Failed if any issue during execution |
| <b>Git Commit</b> | Commits the terraform_files folder to OCI DevOps GIT Repo. This will trigger respective terraform_pipelines| Pipeline stops further execution if there is nothing to commit. <b>In some cases when tfvars was generated in previous execution, you can navigate to terrafom apply pipeline and trigger that manually </b>|
| <b>Trigger Terraform Pipelines</b> | Corresponding terraform apply pipelines are auto triggered based on the service chosen | |

### terraform_files Folder

This is equivalent to /cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/terraform_files folder on your local system.
You will see region directories inside this and all service directories further inside the region directories.
Inside each service directory, you will see pipelines for terraform-apply and terraform-destroy.

You can navigate to any service directory path and invoke the terraform-apply pipeline.

#### terraform-apply Pipeline Stages :

|Stage Name      | Description  | Possible Outcomes |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Checkout SCM | Checks out the latest terraform_files folder from DevOps GIT repo | |
| Terraform Plan | Runs terraform plan against the checked out code and saves it in tfplan.out | Pipeline stops further execution if terraform plan shows no changes. Displays Failed if any issue while executing terraform plan |
| OPA | Runs the above genrated terraform plan against Open Policies and displays the violations if any | Displays Unstable if any OPA rule is violated |
| Get Approval | Approval Stage for reviewing the terraform plan. There is 24 hours timeout for this stage. | Proceed - goes ahead with Terraform Apply stage. <br> Abort - pipeline is aborted and stops furter execution |
|Terraform Apply | Applies the terraform configurations | Displays Failed if any issue while executing terraform apply |

### Region Based Views
When you click on any of the view, it displays all terraform-apply and terraform-destroy pipelines in single screen. This can also be used to trigger the terraform pipelines.
