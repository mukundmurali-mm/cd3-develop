### 1. setUpOCI Pipeline

This is equivalent to running *setUpOCI.py* from CLI. This will generate the terraform **.auto.tfvars** files based on the CD3 Excel sheet input for the services chosen and commit them to OCI Devops GIT repo. This will also trigger **terraform-apply** pipelines for the corresponding services chosen in setUpOCI pipeline.

Below table shows the stages executed in this pipeline along with their description:

<br>

<details><summary><b>Expand this to view setUpOCI Pipeline Stages</b> </summary>

|Stage Name      | Description  | Possible Outcomes |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| <b>Validate Input Parameters</b> | Validates input file name/size, selected parameters | Displays Unstable if any of the validation fails. Pipeline stops further execution in that case. |
| <b>Update setUpOCI.properties</b> | Updates <customer_name>_setUpOCI.properties with input filename and workflow_type | Displays Failed if any issue during execution |
| <b>Execute setUpOCI</b> | Executes python code to generate required tfvars files. The console output for this stage is similar to setUpOCI.py execution via CLI. <br>Multiple options selected will be processed <i>sequentially</i> in this stage. | Displays Failed if any issue occurs during its execution. Further stages are skipped in that case. |
| <b>Run Import Commands</b> | Based on the workflow_type as 'Export Resources from OCI', this stage invokes execution of tf_import_commands_\<resource\>_nonGF.sh shell scripts which will import the exported objects into tfstate. tf_import_commands for multiple options selected will be processed <i>sequentially</i> in this stage. <br><b> This stage is skipped for 'Create Resources in OCI' workflow </b>| Displays Failed if any issue occurs during its execution. Further stages are skipped in that case. |
| <b>Git Commit</b> | Commits the terraform_files folder to OCI DevOps GIT Repo. This will trigger respective terraform_pipelines| Pipeline stops further execution if there is nothing to commit. <b>In some cases when tfvars was generated in previous execution, you can navigate to terrafom-apply pipeline and trigger that manually </b>|
| <b>Trigger Terraform Pipelines</b> | Corresponding terraform apply pipelines are auto triggered based on the service chosen | |
</details>

### 2. terraform_files Folder

This is equivalent to **/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/terraform_files** folder on your local system.
The region directories along with all service directories, are present under this terraform_files folder.
Inside each service directory, pipelines for **terraform-apply** and **terraform-destroy** are present.

The terraform pipelines are either triggered automatically from setUpOCI pipeline or they can be triggered manually by navigating to any service directory path.

<details><summary><b>Expand this to view terraform-apply Pipeline Stages</b> </summary>

|Stage Name      | Description  | Possible Outcomes |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Checkout SCM | Checks out the latest terraform_files folder from DevOps GIT repo | |
| Terraform Plan | Runs terraform plan against the checked out code and saves it in tfplan.out | Pipeline stops further execution if terraform plan shows no changes. Displays Failed if any issue while executing terraform plan |
| OPA | Runs the above genrated terraform plan against Open Policies and displays the violations if any | Displays Unstable if any OPA rule is violated |
| Get Approval | Approval Stage for reviewing the terraform plan. There is 24 hours timeout for this stage. | Proceed - goes ahead with Terraform Apply stage. <br> Abort - pipeline is aborted and stops furter execution |
|Terraform Apply | Applies the terraform configurations | Displays Failed if any issue while executing terraform apply |
</details>

<br>


<details><summary><b>Expand this to view terraform-destroy Pipeline Stages</b></summary>

|Stage Name      | Description  | Possible Outcomes |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Checkout SCM | Checks out the latest terraform_files folder from DevOps GIT repo | |
| Terraform Destroy Plan | Runs `terraform plan -destroy` against the checked out code | Displays Failed if any issue in plan output |
| Get Approval | Approval Stage for reviewing the terraform plan. There is 24 hours timeout for this stage. | Proceed - goes ahead with Terraform Destroy stage. <br> Abort - pipeline is aborted and stops furter execution |
|Terraform Destroy | Destroys the terraform configurations | Displays Failed if any issue while executing terraform destroy |
</details>
<br>

### 3. Region Based Views
When you click on any of the views, it displays all terraform-apply and terraform-destroy pipelines in single screen. This can also be used to trigger the terraform pipelines. This also includes Global view for global services like RPC.
