CD3 stands for **Cloud Deployment Design Deliverable**. The CD3 Automation toolkit enables you to effortlessly Build, Export and Manage OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastruture) resources within minutes ‚ö°Ô∏è .

<br>


### Why CD3?


‚è≥ For Enterprise infrastructures, manual resource provisioning is tedious and error-prone.

üìù While Terraform automates, filling variable values for each module can be cumbersome and requires Terraform expertise.

üîÅ Manually created configs are hard to reuse for different environments or deployments .

<br>

###  How CD3 works?


(cd3logo -yet to be added)

<br>

The toolkit transforms input data from Excel files into Terraform files, enabling seamless creation of infrastructure in OCI.

**CD3 isn't just about creation!!!** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Reverse engineer existing infrastructure back into Excel and gain complete control over your OCI resources lifecycle. 

üìú The generated Terraform code can be used by the OCI Resource Manager or can be integrated into organization's existing Devops CI/CD ecosystem.


<br>

### üë• Who can use the toolkit??

  Anyone who wants to create or export OCI resources without much effort. 

<br>

### üí° Benefits of CD3:


  ‚úÖ Time savings ‚è∞ 
  
  ‚úÖ Faster infrastructure provisioning üöÄ
  
  ‚úÖ Scalability üìà
  
  ‚úÖ Operational efficiency ‚öôÔ∏è

<br>

**Secure architecture üõ°Ô∏è:** CD3 toolkit helps customers deploy secure standardization across OCI tenancies by providing CIS-compliant Excel templates. It also enables native execution of the CIS Compliance Checker script against your tenancy.

**DevOps-oriented üîÑ:** The toolkit facilitates integration of consistent output Terraform files in module format with any continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) solution. The Terraform code can be reused to build similar workloads in different OCI regions and tenancies, which helps in quicker adoption of OCI.

**Platform independent üåê:** CD3 is packaged as a container that can be hosted on any platform.

<br>


First, The Excel file is input to the CD3 Automation toolkit using either CLI or Jenkins.  

>Note: üìñ Detailed documentations and videos are provided for both options. 

Based on the workflow selected (create/export), the toolkit processes the next steps.


**Create resources:**

- The input Excel file is processed by the toolkit and terraform *auto.tfvars files are generated for all those reosurces. 

- The generated terraform files can be used to deploy resources in OCI by generating a terraform plan and approving the plan for apply. 

**Export resources**

- The input Excel (preferably the Blank template) is processed by the toolkit and resources are exported to CD3 Excel template. 

- The toolkit then generates *auto.tfvars from the exported data in Excel file and also generates shell scripts with terraform import commands for all the reosurces.

- The shell scripts have to be executed in order to have the updated state file to manage the resources further.
