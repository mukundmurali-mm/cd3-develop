### Release v6.1

#### Date - July 31, 2020

Below are the highlights of this release:

7. a. Regions property has been removed and now tenancy's subscribed regions will be fetched using API and terraform directories would be created based on that. It would be good to subscribe tenancy to all required regions before setting up OCS Work VM or else create the region directory manually.
b. Regions property has been removed from VCN Info tab of CD3 as well.
  
8. CD3 Validator has been introduced. This will validate Networking tabs as of now. It will check for any Null Values, CIDR overlaps etc.

14. GIT repo has been moved to OCI. SSH key needs to be setup for access to the repo.
Private key is copied over to /root/.ssh folder. It is up to the developers if they want to keep the private key there for any future GIT updates or if they want to remove the key for security reasons.
  
### Release v6.0.1

#### Date - Mar 23, 2020

There was a bug in v6.0 where TF for Instances, FSS, LBR etc was not getting correct subnet name as created for subnets using NEtworking.

It has been corrected and pushed to the master branch.

### Major Release v6.0

Below are the highlights of this release:

1. Support for Non Green Field Tenancies. 
2. Removed common_seclist_name and seclist_per_subnet columns from Subnets Tab. Specify security lists to be created for a subnet as comma separated in seclist_names column.
3. If DNS doesn't need to be enabled for a VCN or subnet, specify 'n' in dns_label column for that VCN or Subnet.
4. Specify 'n' for route_table_name or seclist_names in Subnets tab if only Default Route Table or Default Secuirty List of VCN needs to be attached to the subnet.
5. When you are running Modify Network, if there are any route tables or security lists which are not attached to any subnet or DRG or LPG then it will display the names in output like below:
  
**ATTENTION!!! Below RouteTables are not attached to any subnet or DRG and LPG; If you want to delete any of them, remove the TF file!!!**

**ATTENTION!!! Below SecLists are not attached to any subnet; If you want to delete any of them, remove the TF file!!!**

### Release v5.0.1

There was a bug in LPGs creation/peering. Corrected that and pushed as v5.0.1

### Major Release v5.0

#### Date - Feb 7, 2020

It has many new enhancements and features added to it.

Detailed explanation about CD3 excel is at: CD3 Excel release v5.0

Below are the highlights:

1. yum utility won't break on OCS Work VM. Please use python setUpOCI.py <setUpOCI.properties> cmd and python fetch_compartments_to_variablesTF.py <outdir> cmd to execute automation.
2. Export of rules after network creation is a mandatory step. Single sheet- 'SecRulesinOCI' and 'RouteRulesinOCI' would be used to manage rules in OCI.
3. Color Coding has been added to the exported rules.
4. Support for specifying LPG names has been included. 
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Format to specify LPG names:
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specify either y (like for other components) - this will give default name to the LPG whch is <vcn_name>_lpg<counter> eg ProdVCN_lpg0
 or the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; name that you want to give to the LPG.
  
5. Peering section has been removed and merged in VCNs tab. Format for specifying peering in hub_spoke_peer_none column:
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;specify hub in the column for the VCN you want to mark as hub
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;specify spoke:<hub_vcn_name> if you want to mark a VCN as spoke to hub VCN
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;specify peer:<vcn_name> if you want to establish normal peering between 2 VCNs
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;specify none if the VCN is a normal standalone VCN
  
6. you can specify SGW target for route rules in OCI. specify as either object_storage or all_services
  
When VCNs are specified in hub-spoke model, Route Tables associated with DRG and LPG get created automatically.
Inter subnet communication and egress communication from all subnets is opened via SecRules.
Initial Subnet Route rules are controlled by flags for each target in Subnets Tab.
If any change is required to be done in default sec rules or route rules, they can be modified via cd3 after exporting them.

CSV support for this version is still under progress.
  
### Major Release v4.0

> **Note** 
 >This version would require you to change your excel file and use the latest one since there is a column addition in the existing sheet.

1. Added support to add a common security List across subnets apart from just Default Security List. This is done by adding a new column in Subnets tab "common_seclist_name" which specifies name of common seclist to be created and used for each subnet
&nbsp; &nbsp;  If left blank for a particular subnet that means the common seclist doesnt not need to be assigned to that subnet.
2. Modified output files created for routes. Earlier tool used to create one TF file for all route tables. Now it would generate separate file for each Route Table like it does for Security List.
3. Introduced option to create new VCN under Update Network
4. Added Default DHCP options also to TF like for Default Security List
5. Added support to include Description for a rule in NSGs. Added new column for this
6. Modified DB Systems creation code. Separated tabs for DB system - VM, BM and Exa
7. Fixed some minor issues with existing code
