### 1. setUpOCI Pipeline

This is equivalent to running *setUpOCI.py* from CLI. This will generate the terraform **.auto.tfvars** files based on the CD3 Excel sheet input for the services chosen and commit them to OCI Devops GIT repo. Additionally, it also triggers **terraform-apply** pipelines for the corresponding services chosen in setUpOCI pipeline.

Below table shows the stages executed in this pipeline along with their description:


<b><i>setUpOCI Pipeline Stages</i></b>

|Stage Name      | Description  | Possible Outcomes |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| <b>Validate Input Parameters</b> | Validates input file name/size, selected parameters | Displays Unstable if any of the <br> validation fails. Pipeline stops <br> further execution in that case. |
| <b>Update setUpOCI.properties</b> | Updates <customer_name>_setUpOCI.properties <br> with input filename and workflow_type | Displays Failed if any issue during execution |
| <b>Execute setUpOCI</b> | Executes python code to generate required <br> tfvars files. The console output for this <br> stage is similar to setUpOCI.py execution via CLI. <br>Multiple options selected will <br> be processed <i>sequentially</i> in this stage. | Displays Failed if any issue occurs  <br> during its execution. Further stages <br> are skipped in that case. |
| <b>Run Import Commands</b> | Based on the workflow_type as 'Export Resources from OCI', <br> this stage invokes execution of <br> tf_import_commands_\<resource\>_nonGF.sh <br> shell scripts which will import the  <br> exported objects into tfstate. tf_import_commands for <br> multiple options selected will be  <br> processed <i>sequentially</i> in this stage. <br><b> This stage is skipped for 'Create Resources in OCI' workflow </b>| Displays Failed if any issue occurs during its execution.  <br> Further stages are skipped in that case. |
| <b>Git Commit</b> | Commits the terraform_files folder to OCI DevOps GIT Repo. <br> This will trigger respective terraform_pipelines| Pipeline stops further execution if there is <br> nothing to commit. <b>In some cases when tfvars was generated in previous execution, <br> navigate to terrafom-apply pipeline and trigger that manually </b>|
| <b>Trigger Terraform Pipelines</b> | Corresponding terraform apply pipelines <br> are auto triggered based on the service chosen | |



### 2. terraform_files Folder

This is equivalent to **```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/terraform_files```** folder on your local system.
The region directories along with all service directories, are present under this terraform_files folder. The toolkit will generate the .tfvars files for all resources under the service directory.
Inside each service directory, pipelines for **terraform-apply** and **terraform-destroy** are present.

The terraform pipelines are either triggered automatically from setUpOCI pipeline or they can be triggered manually by navigating to any service directory path.


<b><i>terraform-apply Pipeline Stages</I></b>

|Stage Name      | Description  | Possible Outcomes |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Checkout SCM | Checks out the latest terraform_files <br> folder from DevOps GIT repo | |
| Terraform Plan | Runs terraform plan against the <br> checked out code and saves it in tfplan.out | Pipeline stops further execution if  <br> terraform plan shows no changes. <br> Displays Failed if any issue while executing terraform plan |
| OPA | Runs the above genrated terraform plan against <br> Open Policies and displays the violations if any | Displays Unstable if any OPA rule is violated |
| Get Approval | Approval Stage for reviewing the terraform plan. <br> There is 24 hours timeout for this stage. | Proceed - goes ahead with Terraform Apply stage. <br> Abort - pipeline is aborted and stops furter execution |
|Terraform Apply | Applies the terraform configurations | Displays Failed if any issue <br> while executing terraform apply |




<b><i>terraform-destroy Pipeline Stages</i></b>

|Stage Name      | Description  | Possible Outcomes |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Checkout SCM | Checks out the latest terraform_files <br> folder from DevOps GIT repo | |
| Terraform Destroy Plan | Runs `terraform plan -destroy` <br> against the checked out code | Displays Failed if any issue in plan output |
| Get Approval | Approval Stage for reviewing the terraform plan. <br> There is 24 hours timeout for this stage. | Proceed - goes ahead with Terraform Destroy stage. <br> Abort - pipeline is aborted and stops furter execution |
|Terraform Destroy | Destroys the terraform configurations | Displays Failed if any issue <br> while executing terraform destroy |


### 3. Region Based Views
Clicking on any of the views displays all terraform-apply and terraform-destroy pipelines in a single screen. This can also be used to trigger the terraform pipelines. This also includes Global view for global services like RPC.
