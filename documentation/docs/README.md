The CD3 toolkit reads input data in the form of CD3 Excel sheet and generates Terraform files which can be used to provision the resources in OCI instead of handling the task through the OCI console manually. The toolkit also reverse engineers the components in OCI back to the Excel sheet and Terraform configuration. The toolkit can be used throughout the lifecycle of tenancy to continuously create or modify existing resources. The generated Terraform code can be used by the OCI Resource Manager or can be integrated into organization's existing devops CI/CD ecosystem.

First, The Excel file is input to the CD3 Automation toolkit using either CLI or Jenkins.  

>Note: ðŸ“– Detailed documentations and videos are provided for both options. Please check the left panel for navigation.


**Create resources:**

- The input Excel file is processed by the toolkit and terraform *auto.tfvars files are generated for all those reosurces. 

- The generated terraform files can be used to deploy resources in OCI by generating a terraform plan and approving the plan for apply. 

**Export resources**

- The input Excel (preferably the Blank template) is processed by the toolkit and resources are exported to CD3 Excel template. 

- The toolkit then generates *auto.tfvars from the exported data in Excel file and also generates shell scripts with terraform import commands for all the reosurces.

- The shell scripts have to be executed in order to have the updated state file to manage the resources further.

**Modify resources**

- Resources created or exported using CD3 can be modified at any point of time using the same Excel file.

## ðŸ“œ  Excel Sheet Templates
CD3 Excel sheet is the main input for Automation Toolkit.

Below are the CD3 templates for the latest release having standardised IAM Components (compartments, groups and policies), Network Components and Events & Notifications Rules as per CIS Foundations Benchmark for Oracle Cloud.

Details on how to fill data into the Excel sheet can be found in the Blue section of each sheet inside the Excel file. Make appropriate changes to the templates eg region and use for deployment.
