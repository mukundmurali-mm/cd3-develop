First, The Excel file is input to the CD3 Automation toolkit using either CLI or Jenkins.  

>Note: ðŸ“– Detailed documentations and videos are provided for both options. Please check the left panel for navigation.

###**Create resources**

- The input Excel file is processed by the toolkit and terraform *auto.tfvars files are generated for all those reosurces. 

- The generated terraform files can be used to deploy resources in OCI by generating a terraform plan and approving the plan for apply. 

###**Export resources**

- The input Excel (preferably the Blank template) is processed by the toolkit and resources are exported to CD3 Excel template. 

- The toolkit then generates *auto.tfvars from the exported data in Excel file and also generates shell scripts with terraform import commands for all the reosurces.

- The shell scripts have to be executed in order to have the updated state file to manage the resources further.

###**Modify resources**

- Resources created or exported using toolkit can be modified at any point of time using the same Excel file.

###**Excel Sheet Templates**

- Here are the [templates](ExcelTemplates.md).
