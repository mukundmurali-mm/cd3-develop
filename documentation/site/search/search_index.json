Grouping of generated Terraform files OCI Resource Manager Upload Additional CIS Compliance Features CD3 Validator Features Support for Additional Attributes Migrate Jenkins configuration to Customer Environment Introduction CD3 stands for C loud D eployment D esign D eliverable. The CD3 Automation toolkit has been developed to help in automating the OCI resource object management. It reads input data in the form of CD3 Excel sheet and generates Terraform files which can be used to provision the resources in OCI instead of handling the task through the OCI console manually. The toolkit also reverse engineers the components in OCI back to the Excel sheet and Terraform configuration. The toolkit can be used throughout the lifecycle of tenancy to continuously create or modify existing resources. The generated Terraform code can be used by the OCI Resource Manager or can be integrated into organization's existing devops CI/CD ecosystem.

Note below points while adding VM details in the Instances sheet: \"Display Name\" column is case sensitive. Specified value will be the display name of Instance in OCI console. Optional columns can also be left blank - like Fault Domain, IP Address. They will take default values when left empty. Leave columns: Backup Policy, NSGs, DedicatedVMHost blank if instance doesn't need to be part of any of these. Instances can be made a part of Backup Policy and NSGs later by choosing appropriate option in setUpOCI menu. 4. Note: The column \"SSH Key Var Name\" accepts SSH key value directly or the name of variable declared in variables.tf under the instance_ssh_keys variable containing the key value. Make sure to have an entry in variables_\\ .tf file with the name you enter in SSH Key Var Name field of the Excel sheet and put the value as SSH key value.

Is there a way to verify my input CD3 Excel sheet for any typos/miskates? Yes, please choose 'Validate CD3' option in setUpOCI menu in GreenField workflow. It validates specific tabs of the excel sheet. Please see CD3 Validator Features for more details. 2. Can I use an existing outdir to export the data from OCI? Make sure to use a clean outdir without any .tfvars or .tfstate file. Also use a blank CD3 Excel sheet as export process will overwrite the data in the respective tab. 3. If I am already using the toolkit and my OCI tenancy has been subscribed to a new region, how do i use the new region with toolkit? Re-run createTenancyConfig.py with same details in tenancyConfig.properties file. It will keep existing region directories as is and create new directory for newly subscribed region. 4. How do I upgrade an existing version of the toolkit to the new one without disrupting my existing tenancy files/directories? Please look at Steps to Upgrade Your Toolkit. 5. How do I export instances in batches using different filters? Follow below steps: - Modify the setUpOCI.properties file to set non_gf_tenancy to \"true\". - Choose \"Export Compute\". - Specify the filter - prefix of the instances or specific AD to export. - Once the execution completes, take a backup of the files generated for instances in out directory( __instances.tfvars and tf_import_cmds _instances_nonGF.sh ) and a backup of the 'Instances' tab of the Input CD3 Excel Sheet. - Repeat steps from 1 to 4 to export next set of Instances using another filter. - Once you export all the required instances using multiple filters, move the files from backup to the out directory and then execute all the shell scripts generated for Instances. Consolidate the data of exported instances from the Excel sheet backups. 6. How do I delete a compartment from OCI using the toolkit? Terraform destroy on compartments or removing the compartments details from _compartments.auto.tfvars will not delete them from OCI Console by default. Inorder to destroy them from OCI either - - Add an additional column - enable_delete to Compartments Tab of CD3 Excel sheet with the value TRUE for the compartments that needs to be deleted on terraform destroy.

Run the plan against OPA policies for compliance against CIS. terraform apply - To make the changes defined by Terraform configuration to create, update, or destroy resources in OCI. Note Execute \"Fetch Compartments OCIDs to variables file\" from CD3 Services in setUpOCI menu after you create Compartments. This is a required step everytime you create a compartment via toolkit or via the OCI console. ## Example - Create a Compartment Follow the below steps to quickly provision a compartment on OCI. Use the excel CD3-SingleVCN-template and fill the required Compartment details in the 'Compartments' tab. Make appropriate changes to the template. For Eg: Update the Region value to your tenancy's home region. Once all the required data is filled in the Excel sheet, place it at the location /cd3user/tenancies/ / which is also mapped to your local directory. Edit the setUpOCI.properties at location: /cd3user/tenancies / / _setUpOCI.properties with appropriate values. Update the cd3file parameter to specify the CD3 excel sheet path. Set the workflow_type parameter value to create_resources . (for Greenfield Workflow.) Change Directory to 'cd3_automation_toolkit' : cd /cd3user/oci_tools/cd3_automation_toolkit/ and execute the setupOCI.py file: python setUpOCI.py /cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/<customer_name>_setUpOCI.properties Choose option to create compartments under 'Identity' from the displayed menu. Once the execution is successful, _compartments.auto.tfvars file will be generated under the folder /cd3user/tenancies/ /terraform_files/ / Navigate to the above path and execute the terraform commands: terraform init terraform plan terraform apply Choose Fetch Compartments OCIDs to variables file under CD3 Services in setUpOCI menu. Execute the command to fetch the details of the compartments if it already exists/ created in OCI. These details will be written to the terraform variables file. Repeat the above process (except Step 5) to create other components in OCI. | :arrow_backward: Prev | Next :arrow_forward: | | :---- | -------: |","title":"Create resources in OCI (Greenfield Workflow)"},{"location":"Intro-Jenkins/","text":"Introduction to Jenkins with the toolkit Jenkins Dashbord setUpOCI Pipeline terraform_files Folder Region based Views (including Global directory) 1. setUpOCI Pipeline This is equivalent to running setUpOCI.py from CLI.

Terraform Behavior 1. Create a Load Balancer with Reserved IP: When you create a LBaaS with reserved ip as \"Y\" and do a terraform apply, everything will go smooth and be in sync for the first time. If you do a terraform plan immediately (post apply), you will find that the plan changes the private ip of load balancer to null. This is a behaviour of Terraform. In these scenarios, please add the private ip ocid to the auto.tfvars as shown below before you run a terraform plan again. Once you do the above change, and then execute a terraform plan/apply, you will get the below error and it can be ignored. 2. While exporting and synching the tfstate file for LBaaS Objects, the user may be notified that a few components will be modified on apply. In such scenarios, add the attributes that the Terraform notifies to be changed to the appropriate CD3 Tab of Load Balancer and uncomment the parameter from Jinja2 Templates and Terraform (.tf) files. Re-run the export. 3. Add a new column - \"Freeform Tags\" to the CD3 Excel Sheets as per necessity, to export the tags associated with the resource as well. If executed as-is, Terraform may prompt you to modify resources based on Tags. Example: 4. Toolkit will create TF for only those DRGs which are part of CD3 and skip Route Tables for the DRGs created outside of CD3. This will also synch DRG rules in your tenancy with the terraform state. Note When there are changes made in the OCI console manually, the above options of export and modify can be helpful to sync up the contents/objects in OCI to TF. 5. Match All criteria specified for Route Distribution Statement In DRGs sheet will show below output each time you do terraform plan: The service api is designed in such a way that it expects an empty list for match all. And it sends back an empty list in the response every time. Hence this behaviour from terraform side. This can be safely ignored. 6.

However Linux 8 does not support many packages required by automation toolkit. Hence modified the code to launch Linux 7.8 incase ocs_vm_source_image_ocid is left empty in ocswork.properties. Release v6.1 Date - July 31, 2020 Below are the highlights of this release: Addition of Description field for Security Rules and Route Rules. Keep using same CD3 but just add new column 'RuleDescription' at the end of both the sheets - SecRulesinOCI and RouteRulesinOCI New text files - OCI_Regions and OCI_Protocols have been introduced. If any new region gets supported by OCI, it can be added in OCI_Regions file. Similarly Protocol and its number mapping has been defined in OCI_Protocols file which will be used by Security Rules as well as NSG Rules. Automation Toolkit will now support duplicate compartment names like OCI does. Please refer to CD3-template.xlsx under example folder for sample data. Extra properties specific to OCItoOCI project have been removed from ocswork.properties and a new file ocswork_ocic.properties has been added to accomodate that. Support for multiple OCSWork VMs via separate config_for_delete files. A new input parameter has been added to ocswork.properties file. Support for Reserved Public IP for OCSWork VM. Reserved public IP will be assigned to OCSWork VM which you cna chose to retain also while destroying OCSWork VM. a. Regions property has been removed and now tenancy's subscribed regions will be fetched using API and terraform directories would be created based on that. It would be good to subscribe tenancy to all required regions before setting up OCS Work VM or else create the region directory manually. b. Regions property has been removed from VCN Info tab of CD3 as well. CD3 Validator has been introduced. This will validate Networking tabs as of now. It will check for any Null Values, CIDR overlaps etc. Support for Flex shapes for Instances. Please refer to CD3-template.xlsx under example folder for sample input data. Instead of LinuxLatest and WindowsLatest, OS value in CD3 template has been changed to Linux and Windows respectively. Variable names in variables_ .tf has been changed accordingly. Support for LinuxLatest and WindowsLatest templates for instance will be deprecated from next release. Support for Multiple Listeners for LBRs. Add new column 'ListenerName' in the CD3 sheet. Please refer to CD3-template.xlsx under example folder for sample input data. Support for Multiple export options for FSS. Please refer to CD3-template.xlsx under example folder for sample input data. Support for NSG export/import. Export process for non-greenfield tenancies will support export of NSGs and their import into terraform. GIT repo has been moved to OCI. SSH key needs to be setup for access to the repo. Private key is copied over to /root/.ssh folder. It is up to the developers if they want to keep the private key there for any future GIT updates or if they want to remove the key for security reasons. Release v6.0.1 Date - Mar 23, 2020 There was a bug in v6.0 where TF for Instances, FSS, LBR etc was not getting correct subnet name as created for subnets using NEtworking. It has been corrected and pushed to the master branch. Major Release v6.0 Below are the highlights of this release: Support for Non Green Field Tenancies. Removed common_seclist_name and seclist_per_subnet columns from Subnets Tab. Specify security lists to be created for a subnet as comma separated in seclist_names column. If DNS doesn't need to be enabled for a VCN or subnet, specify 'n' in dns_label column for that VCN or Subnet. Specify 'n' for route_table_name or seclist_names in Subnets tab if only Default Route Table or Default Secuirty List of VCN needs to be attached to the subnet. When you are running Modify Network, if there are any route tables or security lists which are not attached to any subnet or DRG or LPG then it will display the names in output like below: ATTENTION!!! Below RouteTables are not attached to any subnet or DRG and LPG; If you want to delete any of them, remove the TF file!!! ATTENTION!!! Below SecLists are not attached to any subnet; If you want to delete any of them, remove the TF file!!! Release v5.0.1 There was a bug in LPGs creation/peering. Corrected that and pushed as v5.0.1 Major Release v5.0 Date - Feb 7, 2020 It has many new enhancements and features added to it. Detailed explanation about CD3 excel is at: CD3 Excel release v5.0 Below are the highlights: yum utility won't break on OCS Work VM. Please use python setUpOCI.py cmd and python fetch_compartments_to_variablesTF.py cmd to execute automation. Export of rules after network creation is a mandatory step. Single sheet- 'SecRulesinOCI' and 'RouteRulesinOCI' would be used to manage rules in OCI. Color Coding has been added to the exported rules. Support for specifying LPG names has been included. Format to specify LPG names: specify either y (like for other components) - this will give default name to the LPG whch is _lpg eg ProdVCN_lpg0 or the name that you want to give to the LPG. Peering section has been removed and merged in VCNs tab. Format for specifying peering in hub_spoke_peer_none column: specify hub in the column for the VCN you want to mark as hub specify spoke: if you want to mark a VCN as spoke to hub VCN specify peer: if you want to establish normal peering between 2 VCNs specify none if the VCN is a normal standalone VCN you can specify SGW target for route rules in OCI. specify as either object_storage or all_services When VCNs are specified in hub-spoke model, Route Tables associated with DRG and LPG get created automatically. Inter subnet communication and egress communication from all subnets is opened via SecRules. Initial Subnet Route rules are controlled by flags for each target in Subnets Tab. If any change is required to be done in default sec rules or route rules, they can be modified via cd3 after exporting them. CSV support for this version is still under progress. Major Release v4.0 Note This version would require you to change your excel file and use the latest one since there is a column addition in the existing sheet. Added support to add a common security List across subnets apart from just Default Security List. This is done by adding a new column in Subnets tab \"common_seclist_name\" which specifies name of common seclist to be created and used for each subnet If left blank for a particular subnet that means the common seclist doesnt not need to be assigned to that subnet. Modified output files created for routes. Earlier tool used to create one TF file for all route tables. Now it would generate separate file for each Route Table like it does for Security List. Introduced option to create new VCN under Update Network Added Default DHCP options also to TF like for Default Security List Added support to include Description for a rule in NSGs. Added new column for this Modified DB Systems creation code.
